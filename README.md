# Cotton_disease_dection
# Overview
Cotton disease detection is a project that uses machine learning to identify and classify cotton diseases. The project uses a dataset of images of healthy and diseased cotton leaves to train a Machine learning model. The model is then able to identify diseases in new images with high accuracy. This project has the potential to help farmers save money and time by preventing crop losses due to disease.
# Usage
1. Run the application:
   python app.py
2. Access the application through a web browser at http://localhost:5000.
3. Upload an image of a cotton plant and click on the "Detect" button to initiate the classification process.
4. View the classification results displayed on the screen.
# Sections
1. Data Collection:
The data collection process involved gathering images of cotton plants from various sources such as agricultural databases, research institutions, and field surveys.Care was taken to ensure a diverse dataset encompassing different varieties of cotton plants and various stages of growth.Images were labeled with corresponding disease types (e.g., Fusarium wilt, Verticillium wilt, bacterial blight) or labeled as healthy.
2. Training:
The collected dataset was preprocessed to enhance its quality, including resizing images, normalization, and augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the dataset.Deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed for training due to their effectiveness in image classification tasks.Transfer learning techniques were utilized, where pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, or Inception were fine-tuned on the collected dataset to leverage their feature extraction capabilities and improve training efficiency.
The training process involved splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.Various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer settings were tuned to optimize the model's performance.
3. Testing:
After training, the trained model was evaluated on a separate testing dataset to assess its generalization ability and performance on unseen data.Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed to measure the model's performance in classifying cotton plants into different disease categories.Confusion matrices and classification reports were generated to provide detailed insights into the model's performance across different disease classes.The testing results were analyzed to identify areas for further improvement, such as fine-tuning the model architecture, collecting additional data, or adjusting hyperparameters.
